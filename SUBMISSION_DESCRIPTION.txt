QuietClass Notes: Privacy-First Classroom Companion

Problem Statement:
Students and educators often need quick access to AI-powered tools for summarizing articles, simplifying complex text, translating content, and proofreading notes. Existing solutions typically require internet connectivity and send data to cloud servers, raising privacy concerns and limiting offline usage. Educational content may contain sensitive information that should remain on-device. Additionally, students working in classroom environments need tools that respect privacy regulations like FERPA and COPPA.

Solution:
QuietClass Notes is a Chrome extension that leverages Chrome's Built-in AI APIs to provide on-device processing for common educational tasks. The extension ensures privacy by processing all AI operations locally using Gemini Nano, without sending data to external servers. This makes it ideal for classroom environments where privacy and offline capability are essential.
