# Icons

Place your extension icons here:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can use any image editor or online tools to create these icons. For now, placeholder files are created but you'll need to replace them with actual PNG images.
